# Project Task: Predicting Stock Prices Using Historical Data and Other Features

## Overview:
You will build a machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical stock prices and other features, such as stock volume, market trends, and news sentiment. You will use a dataset of historical stock prices and features to train and evaluate your model. Finally, you will use your model to predict future stock prices and evaluate its performance.

## Data:
You will use a dataset of historical stock prices and features for a publicly traded company, such as Apple or Amazon. The dataset includes daily stock prices, trading volumes, and other features, such as market trends and news sentiment, for a period of several years. The data is stored in a CSV file, where each row contains the date, the stock prices, and the other features.

## Tasks:

### Data Preparation:
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Clean the data by removing missing values, duplicates, or other irrelevant data.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, using a ratio of 80:20 or 70:30.
### Feature Engineering:
Calculate additional features that could affect the stock prices, such as moving averages or technical indicators.
Analyze the correlation between the features and the target variable (i.e., stock prices) to identify the most relevant features.
Normalize or standardize the features to avoid bias towards any specific feature.
### Model Selection and Training:
Experiment with different machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to find the best model for your data.
Train the selected model using the training set and the selected features.
Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing set, using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared.
### Model Optimization:
Experiment with different model hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength, to improve model performance.
Use cross-validation to tune the model hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Use techniques such as ensemble learning to combine multiple models and improve their accuracy.
### Model Deployment:
Use the trained model to predict future stock prices for the next few days or weeks.
Compare your predictions with the actual stock prices to evaluate the accuracy of your model.
Provide insights into the factors that influence the stock prices and their predictions, such as market trends, news sentiment, or industry events.

## Deliverables:

A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your code and analysis.
A report summarizing your project, including your data preparation steps, feature engineering, model selection and optimization, and results.
A demo of your model in action, showing how users can input new data (e.g., news sentiment, market trends) and see the predicted stock prices.

## Note:
This is just a general outline of a project on predicting stock prices, and you can modify it to suit your interests. Good luck with your project!
