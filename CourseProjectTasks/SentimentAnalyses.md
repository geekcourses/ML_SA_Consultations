# Project Task: Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Overview:
You will build a machine learning model to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. You will use a dataset of customer reviews and their associated sentiment labels to train and evaluate your model. Finally, you will use your model to classify new customer reviews and interpret the results.

## Data:
You will use a dataset of customer reviews from a fictional online retailer. The dataset includes 10,000 reviews, each labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. The reviews are stored in a CSV file, where each row contains the review text and its associated sentiment label.

## Tasks:

### Data Preparation:
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and other irrelevant words.
Convert the text data into a numerical representation, such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF vectors.
### Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a Support Vector Machine (SVM), using the training set.
Evaluate the performance of your model on the testing set, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Model Optimization:
Experiment with different model hyperparameters, such as regularization strength or kernel type, to improve model performance.
Use cross-validation to tune the model hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
### Model Deployment:
Use the trained model to classify new customer reviews and assign a sentiment label.
Create a simple user interface (can be a command-line tool), to allow users to input a new customer review and see its sentiment label.
Interpret the results and provide insights into the sentiment of the customer reviews, such as identifying the most common positive or negative words or phrases.

## Deliverables:

A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing your code and analysis.
A report summarizing your project, including your data preparation steps, model selection and optimization, and results.
A demo of your model in action, showing how users can input new customer reviews and see their sentiment labels.

## Note:
This is just a general outline of a project on sentiment analysis, and you can modify it to suit your interests. Good luck with your project!
